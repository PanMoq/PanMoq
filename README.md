## ðŸ“š Overview

PanMoq streamlines the experience of using [AutoFixture](https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture) and [Moq](https://github.com/moq/moq4) together - letting AutoFixture create concrete types for you, and using Moq to automatically mock abstract dependencies at the same time.

### ðŸ¥§ PanMoq's API is dead simple

For basic use cases, PanMoq couldn't be any easier to use - just `new` up the `AutoMoqFixture` class, and then invoke `CreateSpecimen` to create an instance of the type you want:

```csharp
// Arrange
var fixture = new PanMoq.AutoMoqFixture();
MyClassToTest myInstanceToTest = fixture.CreateSpecimen<MyClassToTest>();

// Act
var someResult = myInstanceToTest.DoSomething();
```

Need extra data? PanMoq is built around AutoFixture, so it can populate arbitrary types for you all day long:

```csharp
// Arrange
var fixture = new PanMoq.AutoMoqFixture();
var (myInstanceToTest, myString, myInt) = fixture.CreateSpecimen<(MyClassToTest, string, int)>();

// Act
var someResult = myInstanceToTest.DoSomethingElse(myString, myInt);
```

### ðŸ”§ PanMoq's API scales with you

PanMoq is designed to be safe to "build on" during test setup - without worrying about resetting between tests. This necessitates a few qualities:

1. PanMoq's configuration API is fluent.

    ```csharp
    // Arrange
    PanMoq.AutoMoqFixture fixtureBase = new();
    PanMoq.AutoMoqFixture configuredFixture =
        fixtureBase
            .Configure(autofixtureFixture => autofixtureFixture.Freeze<Mock<IMyFavoriteRepository>>())
            .Configure(autofixtureFixture => autofixtureFixture.Freeze<Mock<ISomeOtherService>>());
    var (myInstanceToTest, myString, myInt) = fixture.CreateSpecimen<(MyClassToTest, string, int)>();

    // Act
    var someResult = myInstanceToTest.DoSomethingElse(myString, myInt);
    ```

2. PanMoq's configuration API enforces immutability of the configuration.

    ```csharp
    // (continuing from above)

    var areSameFixture = object.ReferenceEquals(fixtureBase, configuredFixture); // false
    ```

3. PanMoq is stateless.

    PanMoq fixtures don't retain state (by default), so they are safe to setup once and then keep reusing them:

    ```csharp
    private static readonly PanMoq.AutoMoqFixture fixture = new();

    [Fact]
    public void MyTest1()
    {
        var subject = fixture.CreateSpecimen<MyClassToTest>();
    }

    [Fact]
    public void MyTest2()
    {
        var subject = fixture.CreateSpecimen<MyClassToTest>(); // an all-new instance, in an all-new object graph
    }
    ```
